.TH CISHELL v.1 "22 November 2019" "0.1" "CISHELL man page"
.SH NAME
.B CISHELL, hsh - a command language interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.IP
.I hsh [command] [arg] ...

.SH DESCRIPTION
CISHELL (hsh) replicates the command language interpreter (sh) and executes commands read from the standard input or from a file.\


.SH OVERVIEW
CISHELL (hsh) is a command that reads lines from either a file or the terminal, interprets them, and generally executes the commands.\
It is a program that is running when the user compiles BombShell (simple_shell) and runs the executable file, ./hsh. \
CISHELL implements a language that has flow control constructs, steering the computer to execute the commands. It incorporates\
features for interactive use and has the advantage of being in non-interactive mode, allowing the user to pipe commands into hsh such as echo "ls" | ./hsh\
That is, commands can be typed directly to the running shell or can be put into a file and the file can be executed directly by the shell.

.SH INVOCATION
To start up BombShell, you must first compile with gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh and run the executable ./hsh.
If no arguments are present and if the standard input of the shell is connected to a terminal, the shell is considered in interactive mode .
BombShell is designed to interact in Linux or a Unix like system since the shell uses the Linux system calls to retrieve and execute executable programs found in the $PATH. Our version of the shell incorporates the builtin commands "exit" and "env".
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
This secion has information on the included builtin commands incorporated into BombShell
.IP env
writes the current environment to standard output
.IP setenv
sets a new environmental variable or modifies an existing one to the environment
.IP exit
terminates BombShell's processes
.SH EXAMPLE OF EXECUTABLE
Here is an example use of the "ls" command in CISHELL:
.IP
.br
.\&
.RS 1.5i
\&$ ls -l
.br
total 3
.br
\&-rwxrw-r-x 1 vagrant vagrant 5345 Apr 4 14:59 hello.c
.br
\&-rwxrwxrwx 1 vagrant vagrant 5343 Mar 1 22:05 julien.c
.br
\&-rwxrw-r-x 1 vagrant vagrant 5542 Feb 2 09:14 holberton.c
